# Kubernetes the Hard Way in Docker (Only, No Cloud)

This lab follows roughly the same steps as the popular [Kubernetes the
Hard Way] "tutorial" from Kelsey Hightower, but without the cost and
Google Cloud Platform hassle. We just use Docker instead, each running
container as a "compute instance" (machine). This is faster and easier
to get through and focuses on the core learning content (without wasting
time on GCP). We use the built-in network that Docker provides.
